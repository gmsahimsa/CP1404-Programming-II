## Estimations for Practical Tasks

Throughout the course, I estimated about two days to complete each week's practical tasks, summing up to roughly 20 days for the entire subject. Initially, I struggled to accurately identify the logic in code which affected my overall efficiency. However, as the course progressed, particularly around week 10, I found it increasingly easier to dissect and understand the logic behind the programs. This significant improvement allowed me to solve tasks more efficiently, indicating a steady rise in my accuracy throughout the subject.

## Code Reviews

Reviewing code and being reviewed by others has been an enlightening experience. I have come to understand the importance of an external perspective on my code - it provides valuable insights into the clarity and complexity of my work. This feedback mechanism helps me to continually improve the readability of my code. In contrast, when I reviewed other people's code, it offered me a chance to explore different approaches to problem-solving. I was able to learn from these unique perspectives and incorporate some of their methodologies into my own work.

## Practical Tasks

If I were in charge of the subject, I would introduce some changes to the practical tasks. Specifically, I would reduce the number of programs and introduce more engaging and enjoyable projects, such as game development. This alteration would enable us to apply the concepts learned in a fun, interactive manner, which could improve student engagement and understanding.
