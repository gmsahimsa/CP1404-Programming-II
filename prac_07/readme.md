# CP1404 Practicals

## Introduction

This repository contains my practical work for the CP1404 programming subject. 
My name is [GMS Ahimsa], and I am a studying at [James Cook University Singapore].

## Clean Code Lessons

Throughout this subject, I have learned several valuable lessons about clean code. Here are three main takeaways:

1. **Readability**: Write code that is easy to understand by using descriptive variable names, proper indentation, and comments where necessary.
2. **Solving Complex Problems**: Break down complex problems into smaller, reusable functions or modules to make the code more maintainable and easier to debug.
3. **Algorithms**: Choose the most efficient algorithm for a specific task to optimize the code's performance and resource usage.
